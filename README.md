# relatingsepwithcovid19prevalence
ASDRP McMahan Fall 2021 - Big Data Group <br />
This code set is all files for a project to track socioeconomic position with rates of Covid-19 and vaccination. <br />
It has three parts: <br />
1 - Modeling disease spread (modeling-inequality-with-mesa file) <br />
2 - Relating Covid-19 prevalence to socioeconomic position <br />
3 - Relating rates of vaccination to Covid-19 prevalence (vaccinecorrelation)<br />

Additional information on 3: it draws information from 1_vaccinationratiodata_CA, 1_vaccinationratiodata_OR, and 1_vaccinationratiodata_VT. All other files are datasets we used to build and cross-check information in those three csv files.
