Abstract: COVID-19 has demonstrated the implications of economic interactions in our society on disease and vice versa. Multiple studies observe a negative relationship between socioeconomic position (SEP) and rates of disease in infections such as dengue fever, malaria, rabies, hookworm, and tuberculosis. We observed the relationship between Covid-19 and economic factors such as per-capita GDP, net taxable assessed value, public assistance, etc. to find a correlation between such factors and Covid-19. In addition to that, we studied the rates of vaccination and its correlation to economic values, and work towards creating a model for it. Finally, a preliminary model representing the probability-based spread of disease provides us with a baseline to compare the prevalence with. This paper will cover the results and the relationships that we determined between certain economic factors and disease, and our conclusions on it. <br />

This code set is all files for a project to track socioeconomic position with rates of Covid-19 and vaccination. <br />
It has three parts: <br />
1 - Modeling disease spread (modeling-inequality-with-mesa file) <br />
2 - Relating Covid-19 prevalence to socioeconomic position <br />
3 - Relating rates of vaccination to Covid-19 prevalence (vaccinecorrelation)<br />

Additional information on 3: it draws information from 1_vaccinationratiodata_CA, 1_vaccinationratiodata_OR, and 1_vaccinationratiodata_VT. All other files are datasets we used to build and cross-check information in those three csv files.
